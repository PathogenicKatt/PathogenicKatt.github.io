# Doing it for God, With God and for His grace.
- **Question**: *"What is are purpose in this world?"*

## üìúVerses:
- **Psalms 24:1-5** *"The earth is the Lord‚Äôs, and everything in it, the world, and all who live in it; for he founded it on the seas and established it on the waters. Who may ascend the mountain of the Lord? Who may stand in his holy place? The one who has clean hands and a pure heart, who does not trust in an idol or swear by a false god. They will receive blessing from the Lord and vindication from God their Savior."*
- **Reflections**:
    - The verse tells us that, God is above every other thing in this world. That everything that dwells in it is from God. And so because God gave us *free will* meaning that we choose if we want to follow him.
    - But we must be careful that, if we are to choose things of the world, or basically not follow Him, then we might be in danger of following the path of death, pain, regrets, depressions and anger.
    - But if we choose to follow Christ, then we may be blessed and receive the holy spirit that will guide us through this world that is full of darkness.
    - And so again, to receive the blessing we must pursue righteousness, meaning our hearts must be longing for God and not any other God, and refrain from lying and hateful speech.  
- **Epheusians 5:1-11** *"Follow God‚Äôs example, therefore, as dearly loved children and walk in the way of love, just as Christ loved us and gave himself up for us as a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God. But among you there must not be even a hint of sexual immorality, or of any kind of impurity, or of greed, because these are improper for God‚Äôs holy people. Nor should there be obscenity, foolish talk or coarse joking, which are out of place, but rather thanksgiving. For of this you can be sure: No immoral, impure or greedy person‚Äîsuch a person is an idolater‚Äîhas any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God. Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of such things God‚Äôs wrath comes on those who are disobedient. Therefore do not be partners with them. For you were once darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. Live as children of light (for the fruit of the light consists in all goodness, righteousness and truth) and find out what pleases the Lord. Have nothing to do with the fruitless deeds of darkness, but rather expose them."*
- **Reflections**:
    - The scripture says it all, but what stood out for me is that, things of the world are temporary and it's so hurtful to see many of our people falling for the things of the world that can end at anytime, but not knowing that, if you have God as the center of your life, you may live a prosperous(seek God's kingdom first then all things will be added in your life)
    - The sctripture also emphasizes the fact that we should properly represent Him, that we should not deceive people that if you are a christian you can still do things of the world or that you can still entertain sexual immorality. Hence, we must be truth to God, for he sees everything. 
- **1 Peter 2:9** *"But you are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God‚Äôs special possession, that you may declare the praises of him who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light."*

- **Matthew 28:18-20** *"Then Jesus came to them and said, ‚ÄúAll authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age.‚Äù"*
- **Reflections**:
    - So just as Jesus fulfilled his purpose here on Earth, and through him we are saved.
    - And so because we are saved, wouldn't we want to see more people to be saved?
    - We are holding the light and the purpose of the light is to bring goodness around people near it, and because the world is filled with too much darkness that will or might affect our friends and family, and also our children in the future. The darkness has done too much damage to us, we have lost friends because of it, we have lost our loved ones because of it.
    - So Jesus, hands over the light to all those that are saved to move and travel around the world to shine the light to those one in the darkness.
    - How can we sit and watch people die? 
    - How can we sit and watch people commit suicides?
    - How can we sit and watch our people struggle in addictions?
    - If we sit and do nothing, the darkness will take over slowly spread to our kids in the future.
- **Galatians 3:13** *" Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us, for it is written: ‚ÄúCursed is everyone who is hung on a pole.‚Äù"*

- **Deuteronomy 8:10-13** *"When you have eaten and are satisfied, praise the Lord your God for the good land he has given you. Be careful that you do not forget the Lord your God, failing to observe his commands, his laws and his decrees that I am giving you this day. Otherwise, when you eat and are satisfied, when you build fine houses and settle down, and when your herds and flocks grow large and your silver and gold increase and all you have is multiplied,"*
- **Reflections**:
    - The scripture encourages us not to forget God when prosper.
    - Sometimes we forget that we are where we are because of Him.
    - We forget that we have once payed for the things we have right now.
    - Hence, we should always remain grateful, and this shows that we acknowledge our God.

## In conclusion
_The most important thing is by first asking God, what is your purpose and how can you contribute or help his kingdom_
- But in conclusion, i would like to say that, because we were made by his image, automatically we have God in us, meaning he will always be there for us, he has never forsaken us, he showed his love in many ways, and so for God to have favour on us, we have to live in his word and properly represent him, that when people see us that they may see God instead.
- We are blessed to be a blessing!
