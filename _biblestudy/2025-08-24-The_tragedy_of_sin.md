# The Tragedy of Sin (The secret of cup)
- **What is a sin**?
    - A sin is anything that is in contrary to the will of our God.
    - Sin is not an idea of Christians.
    - Sin is as old as the existence of man.
    - *The consciousness of Sin is embedded in the heart of man as much as the will of God is!*
    - But no matter what philosophy we hear regarding sin, or whichever way is sin being described by constitution or from anyone, Sin will always remain punishable to God.
<br>

## The Secret of a Cup
- The is a cup in God's eyes, that keeps getting filled by our sins.
- Every single person and every nation, town, and a village has its own cup.
- Every single time we sin, the cup gets filled. 
- When the cup is full, the cup is handed to its owner, and they may drink God's anger. For the cup will also expose their sins to the public. 
- **Isaiah 51:17** _"Wake yourself, wake yourself, stand up, O Jerusalem, you have drunk from the hand of the LORD, the cup of his wrath(extreme anger), who have drunk to the dregs the bowl, the cup of stagerring."_

<br>
- **The Cup of the whole Universe**:
    - **Matthew 24:15-17** _"'The day is coming when you will see what Daniel the prophet spoke about--The sacrilegous (broader range of disrespectful behaviors) that causes desecration (Treating sacred things disrespectfully) standing in the Holy Place.'(Reader, pay attention!) 'Then those in Judea must flee to the hills. A person out on the deck of a roof must not go down into the house to pack. A person out in the field must not return even to go get a coat!'"_

<br>
- **The Cup of the Nations**:
    - **Jeremiah 25:15-16** _"This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, said to me:'Take from my hand this cup filled to the brim with my anger, and make all the nations to whom i send you drink from it. When they drink from it they will stagger, crazed by the warfare i will send against them'"_
    - **Reflections**: And we see this happening to other countries, in this modern era. When this cup is handed to our nation, nothing will stop it, and everyone in it, will be affected. It is our duty, to be intercessors of the nation.

<br>
- **The Cup of the Societal level (villages, towns and cities)**
    - **Genesis 18:20** _"So the LORD told Abraham, 'I have heard the outcry from Solomon and Gomorrah, because their sin is so fragrant. I am going down to see if their actions are as wickked as i have heard. If not, i want to know.'"_ 
    - **Reflections**: From this verse we see that, the cup of Solomon and Gomorrah is calling for God to act. 

<br>
- **Sin is Punished or Exposed at its escalation**:
    - **Genesis 15:16** _"It will be four generations before your descendants come back here, because i will drive out the Amorities until they become so wicked that they must be punished"_

<br>
## Someone drank the cup we deserved
- **Matthew 26:39** _"He went a little further, threw himself face downwards on the ground, and prayed, 'My father, if it is possible, take this cup of suffering from me! Yet not what i want, but what you want'"._
    - **Reflections** _A man, had to pay a price of our sins!, and the bible tells us that, we have to accept Jesus as our LORD and Saviour, for those debts to be cleared. Also not only accept him  but turn away from those debts._

<br>
- **Confession & Repentance**
    - Confession empties the cup
    - **Proverbs 28:13** _You will never succeed in life if you try to hide your sins. Confess them and give them up; then God will show mercy to you._

<br>
## In conclusion
- **2 Peter 3:9** _Do not pay back evil with evil or cursing with cursing: Instead pay back with a blessing, because a blessing is what God promised to give you when he called you._
- **2 Peter 3:10** _As the scripture says "Whoever wants to enjoy life and wishes to see good times, must keep from speaking evil and stop telling lies. They must turn away from evil and do good; they must strive for peace with all their hearts. For the LORD watches over the righteous and listens to their prayers; but he opposes those who do evil."_
