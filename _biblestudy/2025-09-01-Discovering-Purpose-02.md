*It is dangerous to live without God!* If we don't know God, we'll never know the reason of our existence.<br> And if we do not know why we were born, we could live a completely wrong life.
One of the reason why Jesus knew his purpose, is that he was continously seeking and communicating with God. And this is the pattern we have to follow. This allows us to understand the Creator of all things, and as we keep engaging with him, he will reveal to us, our purpose.
## Stopped in the Middle of Traffic
- **"Stopped in the middle of traffic"**, what does that mean? <br><br>
    -> There are many good people who are persuading careers, goals and other things, but only to find that, whatever they are persuading, they are not fully satisified with it. They find themselves, exhausting the strength that was supposed to be for a goal, God paved for them. <br>
    -> We see this in our everyday lives, there're people that, you could see that they are not happy with the jobs they have, and the outcomes of that are, anger, regrets, stress and even depression.<br>
    -> So it is important that, as we make goals, that we should allow God to pave and craft the path, to our Goals. <br>
    -> It is only God, who knows us fully. He knows our strengths and weaknesses, and he will never lead us to things that He knows that will destroy us emotionally or even physically.<br>
    -> So the narrative of *Stopped in the Middle of Traffic* is that, let's say you bought a very beautiful car, and it's brand new. And so what are your expectations of that car? That it should take you from one stop to another, but now in this case, let's say it just suddenly stops in the middle of Traffic, it just stops working. Are you not gonna get fustrated!. And so it said that, many people are exactly like that car. It is very good looking on the outside, but it is not fullfilling it's purpose; that is to make you mobile. We spend years and years, doing something that *looks good*, but we do not know God, or we know little about Him.

- **Isaih 55:6-9**: _"Seek the Lord while he may be found; call on him while he is near. Let the wicked forsake their ways and the unrighteous their thoughts. Let them turn to the Lord, and he will have mercy on them, and to our God, for he will freely pardon. 'For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways,' declares the Lord. As the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts."_
<br>

- **Ephesians 2:1-10** _"You were living in your sins and lawless ways. But in fact you were dead. You used to live as sinners when you followed the ways of this world. You served the one who rules over the spiritual forces of evil. He is the spirit who is now at work in those who don’t obey God. At one time we all lived among them. Our desires were controlled by sin. We tried to satisfy what they wanted us to do. We followed our desires and thoughts. God was angry with us like he was with everyone else. That’s because of the kind of people we all were. But God loves us deeply. He is full of mercy. So he gave us new life because of what Christ has done. He gave us life even when we were dead in sin. God’s grace has saved you. God raised us up with Christ. He has seated us with him in his heavenly kingdom. That’s because we belong to Christ Jesus. He has done it to show the riches of his grace for all time to come. His grace can’t be compared with anything else. He has shown it by being kind to us. He was kind to us because of what Christ Jesus has done. God’s grace has saved you because of your faith in Christ. Your salvation doesn’t come from anything you do. It is God’s gift. It is not based on anything you have done. No one can brag about earning it. We are God’s creation. He created us to belong to Christ Jesus. Now we can do good works. Long ago God prepared these works for us to do."_

## In Conclusion

Living without God is like a car that looks perfect on the outside but fails to move, it misses its true purpose. No matter how successful or busy we appear, if we are not aligned with God’s plan, we will always feel unfulfilled. <br><br>
God alone knows the path that leads to true satisfaction and meaning. When we seek Him, trust His ways above our own, and allow Him to guide our steps, we discover the purpose for which we were created. Let’s choose to seek God daily, trust His higher thoughts, and walk in the good works He has prepared for us.
