## Stopped in the Middle of Traffic
- It is dangerous to live without God! If we don't know God, we'll never know the reason of our existence. And if we do not know why we were born, we could live a completely wrong life.
- One of the reason why Jesus knew his purpose, is that he was continously seeking and communicating with God. And this is the pattern we have to follow. This allows us to understand the Creator of all things, and as we keep engaging with him, he will reveal to us, our purpose.
- "Stopped in the middle of traffic", what does that mean? <br>
    -> There are many good people who are persuading careers, goals and other things, but only to find that, whatever they are persuading, they are not fully satisified with it. They find themselves, exhausting the strength that was supposed to be for a goal, God paved for them. <br>
    -> We see this in our everyday lives, there're people that, you could see that they are not happy with the jobs they have, and the outcomes of that are, anger, regrets, stress and even depression.<br>
    -> So it is important that, as we make goals, that we should allows God to pave and craft the path, to our Goals. <br>
    -> It is only God, who knows us fully. He knows our strengths and weaknesses, and he will never lead us to things that He knows that will destroy us emtionally or even physically.
    -> So the narrative of *Stopped in the Middle of Traffic* is that, let's say you bought a very beautiful car, and very brand new. And so what are your expectations of that car? That it should take you from one stop to another, but now in this case, let's say it just suddenly stops in the middle of Traffic, it just stops working. Are you not gonna get fustrated!. And so it said that, many people are exactly like that car. It is very good looking on the outside, but it is fullfilling it's purpose; that is to make you mobile. We spend years and years, doing something that *looks good*.
