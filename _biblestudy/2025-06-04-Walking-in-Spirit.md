## üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Walking in Spirit
---
- Note the difference between "walked" and "walking" in spirit. This implies that we should continue, and not let it be a thing of just that moment or that day, but we should continually seek His presence.

## 1 Peter 5:8
- "Be alert, Be on the watch! Your enemy, the devil, roams round like a roaring lion, looking for someone to devour"
- What is to devour?
    - To devour is to eat up or to destroy.
    - It makes sense, right?
### Reflection:
    - The devil is always nearby, waiting for that precious opportunity, and he has time‚Äîhe will wait, even if it takes years. But what is important is that he is always there.
    - Hence, sin is just right there at the door, as the devil waits to draw you to that sin.
    - Mind you, the devil will present that specific sin for that moment, because he knows your weaknesses! A sin that matches exactly that feeling as he gets the opportunity.

## üôè John 4:24
- "God is spirit, and only by the power of his spirit can people worship him as he really is."
### Reflection:
    - This verse emphasizes the title of the bible study, that we should walk in spirit just as our God is spirit.
    - There is something important about the spirit and taking care of it.
    - What this means is that the spirit is contrary to the flesh. One said that, "our flesh is a naughty child."
    - Again, the next verse emphasizes this distinction between the flesh and the spirit, Galatians 5:16.
    - I want to add something: we must be careful of what we feed the most‚Äîthe flesh or the spirit. Because if the flesh overcomes the spirit, then you are going to have a hard time making decisions, because what you have done is blinded the spirit, which is meant to guide you or help you in decision-making.

## Galatians 5:16-18 "The Spirit and Human Nature (The Flesh)"
- "What I say is this: Let the spirit direct your lives and you will not satisfy the desires of the human nature. 17 For what our human nature wants is opposed to what the spirit wants, and what the spirit wants is opposed to what our human nature wants. These two are enemies and that means you cannot do what you want to do. 18 If the Spirit leads you, then you are not subject to the Law."

## In conclusion
*Feed the Holy Spirit with the Word and starve the flesh* ‚Äî You should experience the difference! ‚ú®
