## Rule of life
_"Children are destined for the 'Fear of the LORD', 'Church', 'Intercession' and living for God's glory," says our Pastor._ <br>
- **Proverbs 22:6** _"Teach Children how they should live, and they will remember it all their lives."_<br>
    - **Reflection**: Our Pastor also said something important, which is that "the government takes children very seriously more that we do, the government hides the truth from the kids, as we all know about the theory of evolution. ", He also mentioned that, "We as a church, we are no where to be found in terms of taking the kids very seriously, where are we as church?". The world offers many voices and influences, but it is the responsibility of families and the church to help children know Godâ€™s truth and love.
<br>
<br>

- **Judges 13:8** _"Then Manoah prayed to the LORD, 'Please LORD, let the man of God you sent come back to us and tell us what we must do with the boy when he is born.'"_
- **Judges 13:12** _"Then Monoah asked, 'when you words come true, what must the boy do? what kind of a life must he lead?'"_
    - **Reflection**: From the scripture we see that Manoah asked God for guidance on how to raise his child, and this tells us that parents also need wisdom from God to help their children live the right way. 
<br>
- **Proverbs 22:15** _"Children just naturally do silly, careless things, but a good spanking will teach them how to behave."_
## In conclusion
Raising children is a great responsibility and a blessing. Parents, the Community and the church, must guide them to know God, pray for them, and set a good example. <br>
_"When we teach children to love God and live for His glory, we help unlock their true destiny and prepare them for a life of purpose and faith."_
