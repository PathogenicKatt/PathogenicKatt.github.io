## You Cannot Be Silent!
_"When Jesus comes back, pray that he may not find you sleeping in the wrong time"_<br>

- **Esther 4:14** _"For if you remain silent at this time, relief and deliverance for the Jews will arise from another place, but you and your fatherâ€™s family will perish. And who knows but that you have come to your royal position for such a time as this?"_
    - **Core Message**: God has placed us where we are for a purpose. Our *inaction* has consequences, not just for others but for us as well. But our *courageous-action*, born from our unique position, can be the key to deliverance. <br>
    -> The Pastor mentioned that, "If someone were to come to you, and ask for help, and you are unable to help then you are sleeping in incorrect time."<br>
    -> So in this case Queen Esther, had hidden her identity, and a genocidal decree has been issued against her people by the king's advisor, and her cousin Mordecai told her she must risk her life by going to the king unsummoned to plead for her people. So Esther decided to stay safe, quiet not take action. <br>
    -> And Mordecai tells that, Esther's privilege, position, and her influence was not by mistake, or an accident but it was a divine setup for a critical moment. <br>
    - **Reflection**: <br>
    -> Like Esther, many of us enjoy comfort and safety. We fear rejection, cancellation, or conflict. Our instinct is to remain silent. <>
    -> From this verse we see that, Mordecai tells that the positions we find ourselves, are a platform that God has placed us in, to take action in, and our Pastor also mentiones that, "our neighbours as well, they are our mission, and that God has sovereignly placed us where we are right now." <br>
    -> To remain silent is to miss our divine purpose.

<br>
- **1 Chronicles 12:32** _"from Issachar, men who understood the times and knew what Israel should do"_
    - **Context**: If you read the entire chapter, you see that it lists brave men who joined David at Hebron to help make him king of Israel.
    - **Reflection**:<br>
    -> Issachar's Strength, was mostly for their discernment,they understood the times, they saw what was really happening, and they knew the right course of action. <br>
    -> A key takeaway is that, it is important that we should always ask our God, to teach us on how to discern during such moments. God needs people who are not just brave, but also discerning.

## In conclusion
- We live in confusing and anxious times. It's easy to feel overwhelmed, to want to retreat into our own lives, our homes, and our churches, and just be silent until it all blows over. 
- But God's word tells us that silence is not an option. He has equipped us not just to survive this moment, but to speak into it with courage and wisdom.
- We cannot be silent because to do so would be to deny the very purpose God has for our life. 
- And hence, we need to *"Answer the call for such a time as this"*.
