## Ascension: "Behold the Man"
---
### Translations Comparison:
- **NASB**:  
  "Jesus then came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. And Pilate said to them, 'Behold, the Man!'"
- **NIV**:  
  "When Jesus came out wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe, Pilate said to them, 'Here is the man!'"
- **NLT**:  
  "Then Jesus came out wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. And Pilate said, 'Look, here is the man!'"


### Key Reflection:

> This moment foreshadows His sacrificial love and the redemption He brings. ❤️

## Man's Lost Position — Unworthy
---
### 📜 Scripture: Exodus 33:20-21 (BSB)
> "But," He said, "you cannot see My face, for man shall not see Me and live."  
> And the LORD said, "Behold, there is a place by Me where you shall stand on the rock."

### 🪨 Reflection:
- This passage underscores the **holiness of God** and the inherent **unworthiness of humanity** to stand in His presence.
- Yet, God provides a way—**symbolized by the rock**—foreshadowing Christ as our mediator (1 Timothy 2:5).

## Conclusion: Living in Light of the Ascension
---
### Scripture: Colossians 3:1, 4-5 (NKJV)
> "If then you were raised with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ is, sitting at the right hand of God.  
> When Christ who is our life appears, then you also will appear with Him in glory.  
> Therefore put to death your members which are on the earth: fornication, uncleanness, passion, evil desire, and covetousness, which is idolatry."

### Key Points:
- **Heavenly Perspective**:  
  -  As believers, we are called to focus on eternal truths, not earthly distractions.
- **Hope of Glory**:  
  -  Christ's ascension assures our future resurrection and union with Him.
- **Practical Holiness**:  
  -  We must actively reject sinful behaviors that hinder our spiritual growth.


### Application Questions:
-  How does Pilate's statement in John 19:5 deepen your understanding of Jesus' sacrifice?
-  In what areas of your life do you need to "seek the things above" (Colossians 3:1)?
-  What steps can you take to "put to death" sinful habits (v. 5) this week?
