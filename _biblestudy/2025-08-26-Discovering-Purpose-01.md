Many times we do things without having a clear direction, and hope that it will work out. If we present our unclear plans to God, how do we expect Him to direct us. So, it is very important to have a clear picture of how or where we want to see ourselves. Then follows **Psalms 37:5** *"Commit everything you do to the LORD. Trust Him, and He will help you."*
- **Consider the following questions:**
    - *If someone were to ask you, where are going, could you answer that you're headed somewhere?*
    - *Could you specify where?*
    - *Are you so clear about your dreams that you could paint a picture of it?*
<br>
- **Prayer:**
    - _Dear Father. You are the Creator, the Maker of all things, including me. <br>You have a purpose for my creation beyond anything i can easily understand.<br> Help me to keep my upon You and Your Word as You reveal my purpose on this earth.<br> In Jesus's name, amen._
<br>

## Living by the Spirit's Power
- **Ephesians 5:15-20** _"So be careful how you live. Don't live like fools, but like those who are wise. Make the most of every opportunity in these evil days. Therefore do not be foolish, but understand what the Lordâ€™s will is. Don't be drunk with wine, because that will ruin your life. Instead, be filled with the holy Spirit. speaking to one another with psalms, hymns, and songs from the Spirit. Sing and make music from your heart to the Lord, And give thanks for everything to God the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ."_
    - **Reflections**: <br>
    -> A lot of the times, we tend to do things by the flesh. We approach things by the desire of the flesh but not of the Holy Spirit. We have seen how many times what living our lives by our flesh, lead to. A few examples are, regrets and depressions; these are the results of living by the flesh. <br>
    -> But as soon as we allow our holy spirit to make decisions for ourselves, a lot of times we see that, in return we thank God for those decisions. It also says in the bible that, living by the holy spirit, guarantees safety.

## Allowing God to Dictate our plans
- **Proverbs 16:1** _"We can make our own plans, but the LORD gives the right answer."_
- **Proverbs 16:3** _"Commit your actions to the LORD, and your plans will succeed."_
- **Proverbs 16:9** _"We can make our plans, but the LORD determines our steps."_
- **Proverbs 16:13** _"The king is pleased with words from righteous lips; he loves those who speaks honestly."_
- **Proverbs 16:16** "_The path of the virtuous leads away from evil; whoever follows that path is safe._"
- **Proverbs 16:20** "_Those who listen to the instruction will prosper; those who trust the LORD will be joyful._"

## In conclusion
- For as long as we allow God to be the center of our lives, for God to dictate our journey, we should know that, evrything that is of Him, never fails. 
- It might not always go well, but during those seasons, God, prepares us for what's coming. To be able to handle the blessings that he has in store for us.
- May we keep in mind, and include him in everything we do. Everything that glorifies Him.
