# The Annointing that Breaks the Yoke
- **1 Samuel 16:6-7** *"When they arrived, Samuel took one look at Eliab and though,'surely this is LORD's annointed!'"*
    - **Context**: Samuel is sent to anoint one of Jesse’s sons as the next king of Israel. Eliab, who seemed like an obvious choice because of his physical appearance, but God rejects him.
    - **Reflections**: The bible tells us that, our God does not look at the physical appearance, like we do. But He looks at the heart. Again, this tells us that, as someone who accepted Christ, many might think that they are more holy than others, because of their actions, but when we properly examine the person, we find that, they are not as holy as we thought.

<br>
- **1 Samuel 16:13** *"So as David is there among his brothers, Samuel took the flask of olive oil he had brought and annointed David with the oil. And the Spirit of the LORD came powerfully upon David from that day on. Then Samuel returned to Ramah."*
    - **Context**: David, the youngest, who seemed very unlikely to be chosen, is anointed king.
    - **Reflections**: True anointing brings God’s presence and breaks limitations. Like David, we are chosen not by status but by surrender to God’s will. Another important point is that, when David, was annointed, he went back to the flock. And this outlines that, it does not mean that when we have been annointed that, we are now, better than others.

<br>
- **1 Samuel 17:38-40** *"Then Saul gave David his own (armor, helmet and a coat of mail). David put it on, strapped the sword over it, and took a step or two to see what it was like, for he had never worn such things before. 'I can't go in these and i am not used to them'-said David. So David took them off again."*
    - **Context**: Facing Goliath, David rejects Saul’s armor, symbolizing reliance on human strength and trusts God’s anointing instead.
    - **Reflections**: Again, it is shown here that, we tend to underestimate people by their physical appearance, becuase David was young and has never fought in a war, he was despised. But through God, he was able to face things that were even bigger than him. David has seen God's power, and he knew that, for as long he has surrendered his life to God, then through him God, can reveal his power. We do not have use things of the world, created by humans to face battles, but with faith, chains are broken.

<br>
- **Luke 1:69** *"He has sent us a mighty Savior from the line of his servant David"*
    - **Context**: Zechariah prophesies about Jesus, the ultimate Anointed One (Messiah), who fulfills David’s lineage and breaks spiritual bondage forever.
    - **Reflections**: As we accept Jesus as our LORD and Savior, we accept the annointing, because Jesus is the fulfillment of all annointing. Through him the yoke of sin, despair and oppression is broken. Also To be precise, it is freely given.

<br>
- **2 Kings 4:1-6** *"The wife of a man from the company of the prophets cried out to Elisha, 'Your servant my husband is dead, and you know that he revered the Lord. But now his creditor is coming to take my two boys as his slaves.' Elisha replied to her, 'How can I help you? Tell me, what do you have in your house?' 'Your servant has nothing there at all,' she said, 'except a small jar of olive oil.' Elisha said, 'Go around and ask all your neighbors for empty jars. Don’t ask for just a few. Then go inside and shut the door behind you and your sons. Pour oil into all the jars, and as each is filled, put it to one side.' She left him and shut the door behind her and her sons. They brought the jars to her and she kept pouring. When all the jars were full, she said to her son, 'Bring me another one.' But he replied, 'There is not a jar left.' Then the oil stopped flowing."*
    - **Context**: A widow’s obedience to Elisha’s instruction releases miraculous provision, breaking the yoke of debt and slavery.
    - **Reflections**: God’s anointing flows when we act in faith with what we have. No matter how small our resources may seem, God can multiply them when we trust Him and take steps of faith.

## In conclusion
- The anointing of God is not about titles, appearances, or our human effort. it’s about His power working through surrendered hearts.
