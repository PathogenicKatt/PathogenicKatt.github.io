## Seven Principles of Purpose
The following seven principles of purpose will help us to understand God's Original intent for us in creation.
1. God is a God of Purpose.
2. God created everything with a purpose.
3. Not every purpose is known to us because we have lost our understanding of God's original intent for us.
4. To discover purpose never ask the creation; ask the creator.
5. Where purpose is not known, abuse is inevitable.
6. God's purpose is a key to our fulfillment.
7. We find our purpose only in the mind of our Maker.<br>
God always knew what He wanted to create before He made it, similarly He always knows what He wants to carry out before He accomplishes it.
