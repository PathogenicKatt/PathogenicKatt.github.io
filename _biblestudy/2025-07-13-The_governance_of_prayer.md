# The Governance of Prayer.
## ðŸ“œVerses
- **James 5:16** *"Therefore confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you may be healed. The prayer of a righteous person is powerful and effective."*
- **Reflections**:
    - Admit your sins, and confess them,so healing may take place.
    - God hears our prayers, but we have to come clean to Him, be truthful in him and surrender all to him.
    - Our hearts have to remain open for our God to take his place, and so He may begin working in you!
    - and Let us not underestimate the power of the prayer.
    - The prayer is both our weapon and a shield that we may use to deal with the world. Hence, what this means is that, prayer is both offensive and defensive.
    - The enemy is always right there at the door waiting for you to skip prayer or to stumble and when he gets that oppoturnity he will use it to the fullest, that there is no chance of you going back to God.
    - and so I Pray that we may never forget that prayer is a power that our God gave us to use when face things of the world and that we may never stop praying even when we have defeated the enemy.


- **Numbers 16:47** *"So Aaron did as Moses said, and ran into the midst of the assembly. The plague had already started among the people, but Aaron offered the incense and made atonement for them."*
- **Reflections**:
    - His act of intercession-standing between the living and the deadâ€”stopped the plague.
    - Aaronâ€™s prayerful action governed the outcome for the people; his intercession brought healing and protection.
    - Just as Aaronâ€™s prayer stopped the plague, our prayers can intervene in difficult situations, demonstrating the authority and power God gives us through prayer.


- **1 Samuel 15:33** *"But Samuel said,
'As your sword has made women childless,
    so will your mother be childless among women.'
And Samuel put Agag to death before the Lord at Gilgal."*
- **Reflections**:
    - This verse describes Samuel executing Agag, the king of the Amalekites, as a consequence of Saulâ€™s disobedience to Godâ€™s command. Samuelâ€™s action was a direct act of obedience and judgment before God.
    - Just as Aaronâ€™s intercession governed life and death, Samuelâ€™s obedience governed justice and the fulfillment of Godâ€™s will.
    - Prayer is not only about asking but also about aligning ourselves with Godâ€™s commands, sometimes requiring difficult actions to uphold Godâ€™s governance.

## In summary
- The message of today is about working together as christians together with God, to bring justice and fullfilment to his word and commands. <br> prayer is a powerful tool given by God to govern situations in our lives. Through prayer and obedience, we can bring healing, protection, justice, and fulfillment of Godâ€™s will.
