# üôè Understanding & Knowing Your Position In Christ
It is important that we lean not to our understanding but to the wisdom. In our everyday life, we should always try to pray to God that he may bless us with the holy spirit of wisdom. This ensure that we play our role in this world to bring it to where it is supposed to be. There are two scriptures (of course there is more) that will help us understand at least a little about our purpose.
- **1 Corinthians 12**
- **Romans 12:4-6**

##  1 Corinthians 12
- " 4 There are different kinds of gifts, but the same spirit distributes them. 5 There are different kinds of service, but the same lord. 6 There are different kinds of working, but all of them and in everyone it is the same God at work."
- " 11 All these are the work of one and the same Spirit, and he distributes them to each one, just as he determines."

### Reflection:
- This scripture emphasizes the fact that, just as a tree has branches, everything is all aligned from the tree itself. To be concise, regardless of the gift or working you may be doing in the Kingdom of work, it is all pointing to the same God. I could be a pastor, and someone else in Christ is an usher, we are both in the same Spirit, and serving one God.
- Another point; "just as he determines" says that God assigns all the gifts accordingly to us and we are to use these gifts to grow and maintain the kingdom of God.

## Romans 12:4
- "For just as each of us has one body with many members, and these members do not all have the same function, 5 so in Christ we, though many, form one body, and each member belongs to all the other. 6 We have different gifts, according to the grace given to each of us. If your gift is prophesying, then prophesy in accordance with your faith; 7 if it is serving then serve; if it is teaching then teach; 8 if it is to encourage then give encouragement; if it is giving, then give generously; if it is to lead, do it diligently; if it is to show mercy, do it cheerfully."

### Reflection:
- This adds more to what Corinthians is saying, but Romans outlines another point, and that is not only are we a member of God, but we are a member of one another. This means, we should care for another, love each other and help one another, because we are all, *one body*.
- Points out our roles in this world. That each and everyone is gifted something and we are to use our gifts to help one another, or bring people to the kingdom of God.

### To add:
- It is important to seek God in respect to ourselves first. Yes, it is important to attend church or homecell. But you need to spend time with God, even when you are alone. Many challenges that you face concern you the most, more than the church, hence you need to be able to defend yourself against the bad spirits through prayer and through the word of God. 
- Do not hide yourself behind the church, the church will not always be there for you. 
- Know God, personally.
- Be a reference to a tree: an apple tree will always produce an apple, a banana tree will always produce a banana. So therefore, just as we are one body of Christ, we have to produce what is right. You may not say that you follow God, but the things that you do, do not correlate.
- Lastly, be careful of what you say. Again, because we are "of the same body", that means all our Angels are the same, and our Angels are always next to us for a reason‚Äîto guide us and defend us from the bad spirits but not from one another, thus making it difficult for the Angels to do the work, because how can an Angel defend itself from another Angel?

## Conclusion
In summary, understanding your position in Christ means recognizing your unique gifts and purpose within the body of Christ. We are all connected, called to support, love, and uplift one another. Seek a personal relationship with God, use your gifts for His glory, and remember that your actions should reflect your faith. Let us strive to be true representatives of Christ in all we do, building up the body and advancing the kingdom of God together. üôå
