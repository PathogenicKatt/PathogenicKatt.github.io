## Kingdom Builders
This is composed of 4 pillars, namely:
- Learn, Know and Teach how to pray properly - **Matthew 6:7-13**.
- God and Possessions - **Matthew 6:31-33**.
- Knowing who really Jesus is - **Matthew 16:13-19**.
- The unity of the body - **Ephesians 4:11-16**

## üôè Matthew 6:7-13:
- "And when you pray, do not keep on babbling like a pagans, for the think they will heard Do not be like them. Your father already knows what you need before you ask him. This, then, shows you how to pray: 'Our Father in Heaven. May Your Holy Name Be Honoured. May Kingdom Come. May You Will Be Done On Earth As It Is On Heaven. Give Us Today The Food We Need. Forgive Us The Wrongs We Have Done. As We Forgive The Wrongs That Others Have Done To Us. Do Not Bring Us To Hard Testing, But Keep Us Safe From The Evil One.'"
### Reflection:
    - The term "babble" refers to the repetitive and meaningless words often used in pagan prayers by the pagans.
    - And so a prayer is a central practice in our lives as believers, reflecing a personal relationship with God.
    - Hence, from the scripture, Jesus emphasizes the importance of sincere communication with God rather than empty repetition. Our prayer should reflect a heartfelt connection with the father.
    - God knows our needs before we ask. 
    - *Focus on Relationship*: Prayer is an opportunity to deepen our relationship with God and so approach it as a conversation with a loving Father who desires to hear from His children.

## Matthew 6:31-33:
- "So do not start worrying, 'Where will my food come from?'or 'my drink?' or 'my clothes?'. (These are the things that the pagans are always concerned about). Your father in heaven knows that you need all these things. But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well."
### Reflection:
    - I think i can relate this scripture to the story of Job, a little. But in short, Job was obedient to God, he feared God even though he was very wealthy, but God took away all his wealth, to test his faithfulness, But because Job remained faithful o God, Our heavenly father blessed him double the wealth he initially had.
    - *"So do not start worrying"*:This phrase is a direct command from Jesus, emphasizing the importance of trusting in God's provision.
    - This reflects again, to Philippians 4:6-7, "faith over fear"

## Matthew 16:13-19:
- "When Jesus came to the region of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, 'Who do people say the Son of Man is?' They replied, 'some say- John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still other, Jeremiah or one of the prophets.'But what about you? he asked. 'Who do say i am?' Simon answered, 'You Are The Messiah, the Son of the living God'. Jesus replied, 'Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah, for this was not revealed to you by flesh and blood, but by my Father in heaven. And i tell you that you are Peter, and this rock i will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not overcome it. I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; whatever ypu bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.'"
### Reflection:
    - *"Who do you people say the Son of Man is?"*:By using this title, Jesus connects His mission to Old Testament prophecy, emphasizing His divine authority and an evalasting kingdom.
    - *"You are the messiah, the son of the living God"*: Messiah, the anointed one, our saviour-"to save humanity" or "to bring redemption" or "to bring salvation to humanity".

## Ephesians 4:11-16:
- "So Christ himself gave the apostles, prophets, the evangelists, the pastors and teachers, to equip his people for works of service, so that the **body of Christ may be built up** until we all reach unity in the faith and become mature, attaining to the whole measure of the *fullness of Christ*. Then we will no longer be infants, tossed back and forth by the waves, and blown here and there by every wind of teaching and by the cunning and craftiness of people in their **deceitful scheming**. Instead, speaking the truth in love, *we will grow to become in every respect the mature body of him* who is the head, that is, Christ. From him the whole body, joined and held together by every supporting ligament, grows and builds itself up in love, as each part does its work."
### Reflection:
    - **And it was He who gave**: The giving of these roles is an act of grace and sovereignty, highlighting that these positions are not self-appointed but divinely ordained.
    - **some to be apostles**: Apostles serve as Christ's messengers and witnesses to His resurrection. The term "apostle" means "one who is sent out".
    - **some to be prophets**: Those who received direct revelation from God to edify, exhort, and comfort the church.
    - **some to be evangelists**: Evangelists are those specially gifted to proclaim the gospel and bring others to faith in Christ. Evangelists are essential for the church's growth and expansion, focusing on outreach and conversion.
    - **some to be pastors and teachers**: The roles of pastors and teachers are often linked, suggesting a dual function of shepherding and instructing the church. Responsible for the spiritual care and guidance of the congregation.
    - Thus, as we work together in unity with all these roles provided for us, to bring about God's kingdom in alignment to God's kingdom in the heaven. 
    - I feel like this emphasizes the fact that when we work together in Christ, we become a strong force that cannot be shaken by the wind, and the forces of the enemy. Hence, being together in Christ is and will always be a good thing to do, than trying to fight the enemy solely ourselves.



## Conclusion
As Kingdom Builders, we are called to seek God first, trust in His provision, recognize Jesus as the foundation of our faith, and work together in unity. Each role and gift in the body of Christ is essential for building up the church and advancing God's kingdom. Let us continue to pray sincerely, trust wholeheartedly, and serve together in love, knowing that together we are stronger and more effective for God's purpose. üôå
