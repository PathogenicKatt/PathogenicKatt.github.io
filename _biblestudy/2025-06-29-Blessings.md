# Spiritual Blessings in Christ 
## ðŸ“œ Verses:
- **Ephesians 1:3-6** *"Let us give thanks to the God and Father our Lord Jesus Christ! For in our union with Christ he has blessed us by giving us every spiritual blessing in the heavenly world. Even before the world was made, God had already chosen us to be his through our union with Christ, so we would be holy and without fault before him. Because of his Love, God had already decided that through Jesus Christ, he would make us his sons and daughters and hence this was his pleasure and purpose. Let us praise God for his glorious grace, for the free gift he gave us in his dear Son!"*
- **Reflections**
    - God has adopted us into his family so that we might praise his glorious grace.
    - The purpose of our salvation is God's glory.
    - This teaches us the Spirit-filled life and the parent-child relationship, the same love relationship we have with our parents.
    - Through the holy spirit we are blessed.

- **Mark 10:20-22** *"'Teacher', the man said, 'Ever since i was young i obeyed all these commandments' Jesus look straight at him with love and said 'You need only one thing. Go and sell all you have and give the money to the poor, and you will have riches in the heaven; then come and follow me.' When the man heard this, gloom spread over his face, and he went away sad, because he was very rich."*
    - a rich young ruler who seeks guidance on inheriting eternal life seems to misunderstande what true righteousness entails.
    - Though he followed or obeyed all the commandments, his heart seem to be more on his wealth than on God.
    - Basically the position of his spirit is not entirely aligned with God, and hence he lacks wisdom.
    - Because his spirit is like 1%, he has fill that void through the things of the world. 
    - So in jesus mighty name, if we seek wisdom from God, love him as he loves us, and have faith in him then we may be able to judge well in situations we encounter everyday, like if you see someone who is in need, and you know that you can help them, then that's where you apply wisdom, because we are children of God, he adopted us to his family, and he is a God that provides, that blesses, that saves lifes, and that forgives, and what more could we ask from him. So as his children, it is important that we represent him, very well!!!.

- **Luke 12:22-23** *"Then Jesus said to his disciples, 'And i tell you not to worry about the food you need to stay alive or about the clothes you need for you body.'Life is much more important than food, and the body is much more important than the clothes."*

- **Galatians 6:7-9** *"Do not deceive yourselves; no one makes a fool of God. People will reap exactly what they sow. If the they sow in the field of their natural desires, from they will gather the harvest of death; if their sow in the field of the of the Spirit, from the Spirit they will gather the harvest of the eternal life, So let us not become tired of doing good;  if if we do not give up, the time will come when we will reap the harvest. "*
- **Reflections**: 
    - Our God is not blind, he sees everything, so you cannot fool him.
    - Becareful of what you sow, and keep in mind of the product.
    - The best we can do, is to try and stay away from the things of the world, though we can play a role to make the world a better place.

## In conclusion ðŸŒŸ 
- Being blessed isnâ€™t about wealth, comfort, or worldly success but it is about:
    - Recognizing our identity as Godâ€™s
    - Trusting God to provide for our needs and not being anxious about material things.
    - Living by the Spirit, sowing good deeds, and persevering in doing what is right.
    - Reflecting Godâ€™s love, grace, and wisdom in our daily lives.
- True blessing is found in a relationship with God, living according to His purpose, and sharing His love with others.
