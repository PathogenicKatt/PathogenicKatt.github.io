title: "The Power of Operating from a legal Position (Who are you)"

## Who are you?<br>
**The Two Realms**:
- **Terrestrial Realm**: <br>
    -> Refers to us, the body & the flesh operating on earth. Meaning, we can legally operate in this *realm*.
- **Celestial (Spiritual) Realm**: <br>
    -> The spirits operating in the Heavens. Which also means that, they may only operate legally in the heavens.
<br>

And So, the spirits that are operating here on earth, without bodies are operating illegal and they have to be rebuked, because they do not belong here. In most cases, these spirits trouble and cause chaos here on earth. In essence, the spirits that do not have body are demons!. There're always searching for available bodies so they can operate legally. If you are not right with **christ**, then you are in trouble. You will always find the people that have been possessed doing very abnormal things.
<br>
This is why Jesus had to be prepared to come as flesh & blood, so that he may operate here on earth legally, otherwise he was going to rebuked as well. And so God knew and knows the conditions of the **terrestrial realm**. 

<br>
**Hebrew 10:5-6** _"Therefore, when Christ came into the world, he said: 'Sacrifice and offering you did not desire, but a body you prepared for me; with burnt offerings and sin offerings you were not pleased.'"_<br>
**Hebrews 10:10** _"And by that will, we have been made holy through the sacrifice of the body of Jesus Christ once for all."_
<br>

Our God also need bodies, and vessels to work in his kingdom. The holy spirit within us goes to the **spiritual realm** to take instructions for us, to fulfill our God's will. And if God does not find you (or if you have a lot going on in your life), he will look for a vessel that is empty:<br>
    - **Acts 19:11-15** _"God did extraordinary miracles through Paul, so that even handkerchiefs and aprons that had touched him were taken to the sick, and their illnesses were cured and the evil spirits left them. Some Jews who went around driving out evil spirits tried to invoke the name of the Lord Jesus over those who were demon-possessed. They would say, “In the name of the Jesus whom Paul preaches, I command you to come out.' Seven sons of Sceva, a Jewish chief priest, were doing this. One day the evil spirit answered them, “Jesus I know, and Paul I know about, but who are you?.'"_<br>

## Assuming a Legal Position (Being Clothed with authority)
- **Spending time with the Master of the Kingdom for Clothing**:
    - **Luke 5:16-17** _"But Jesus often withdrew to lonely places and prayed."_
- **Become a Vessel and a Dwelling Place**:
    - **1 Corinthians 6:19** _"Do you not know that your bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have received from God? You are not your own;"_
- **Become an Ambassador**:
    - **2 Corinthians 5:20** _"We are therefore Christ’s ambassadors, as though God were making his appeal through us. We implore you on Christ’s behalf: Be reconciled to God."_

## In conclusion
- **John 17:11** _"I will remain in the world no longer, but they are still in the world, and I am coming to you. Holy Father, protect them by the power of your name, the name you gave me, so that they may be one as we are one."_
- **John 17:18** _"As you sent me into the world, I have sent them into the world."_
- **John 17:20** _"My prayer is not for them alone. I pray also for those who will believe in me through their message."_
