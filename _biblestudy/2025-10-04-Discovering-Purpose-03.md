"The Greatest Challenge of **Life** is understanding **Life**"
## Understanding Your Purpose
-> We find ourselves living by guesses, and allowing a people to drive us forward with a hope that we make it to our destinations. But if we allow God to take the wheel and drive us in our rightful path, together with Him for He is the Creator of everything. <br><br>
**Psalms 82:5** _"You leaders don’t know anything. You don’t understand anything.
You are in the dark about what is right. Law and order have been destroyed all over the world."_<br>
-> The greatest enemy of mankind is *self-ignorance*, we spend our entire life doing things that are not meant for us, things that our body were not designed for, and so Nothing is more fustrating than not knowing who you are or what to do with what you have. <br><br>
-> But learning God's ways will transform your spirit, your mind, and your outlook.<br>
**Psalms 19:7** _"The law of the Lord is perfect. It gives us new strength. The laws of the Lord can be trusted. They make childish people wise."_<br><br>
-> The greatest way for us to find our purpose is to yield our lives to the Manufacture. We shouldn't go to church be it is "religious" thing to do, We shouldn't go to church because everybody is going there, But we should come to church because we want to find out how to not waste our lives.<br>
**Jeremiah 29:13** _"When you look for me with all your heart, you will find me."_<br>
### Rest for All Who Are Tired
- **Matthew 11:25-29** _"At that time Jesus said, 'I praise you, Father. You are Lord of heaven and earth. You have hidden these things from wise and educated people. But you have shown them to little children. Yes, Father. This is what you wanted to do'. My Father has given all things to me. The Father is the only one who knows the Son. And the only ones who know the Father are the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to make him known. 'Come to me, all you who are tired and are carrying heavy loads. I will give you rest. Become my servants and learn from me. I am gentle and free of pride. You will find rest for your souls.'"_

## In Conclusion

Understanding our purpose begins with seeking God wholeheartedly and allowing Him to guide our lives. As Jesus invites us in Matthew 11:25-29, true rest and fulfillment are found when we come to Him, lay down our burdens, and learn from His gentle and humble heart. When we surrender our own plans and trust the wisdom of our Creator, we move from confusion and self-ignorance into clarity and peace. Let’s choose to seek God with all our hearts, trust His perfect law, and find rest and purpose in Christ.
