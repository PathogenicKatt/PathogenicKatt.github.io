# Four Days With Jesus✨
- So I will be fasting for four days, from 6am to 6pm. ⏰🙏
- This makes sense because I am still a newbie in God's kingdom. So I am taking it easy. 🌱
- I am not doing it alone but as a group. 👥

## Day 01:
- **Scriptures:** 📖

### Psalms 143:8
- *"Let the morning bring me word of your unfailing love, for I have put my trust in you. Show me the way I should go, for to you I entrust my life."* ❤️

### Psalms 5:3
- *"In the morning, LORD, you hear my voice; in the morning I lay my requests before you and wait expectantly."* 🙏

### Mark 1:35
- *"Very early in the morning, while it was still dark, Jesus got up, left the house and went off to a solitary place, where he prayed."* 🌄

### Matthew 14:23
- *"After he had dismissed them, he went up on a mountainside by himself to pray. Later that night, he was there alone,"* 🏔️

### Psalms 91:1-2
- *"Whoever dwells in the shelter of the Most High will rest in the shadow of the Almighty."* 🕊️

### Mark 6:45-46
- *"Immediately Jesus made his disciples get into the boat and go on ahead of him to Bethsaida, while he dismissed the crowd. After leaving them, he went up on a mountain to pray."* 🙏

# Conclusion

Today marks the beginning of my four-day fasting journey with Jesus. Taking these steps, even as a beginner, fills me with hope and excitement for what God will do in my life. The scriptures remind me that seeking God early and spending time in His presence brings strength, guidance, and peace. I am grateful to be part of a group, knowing we are not alone on this path. As I continue, I trust that God will reveal more of Himself and help me grow deeper in faith. Looking forward to what tomorrow brings! ✨🙌
