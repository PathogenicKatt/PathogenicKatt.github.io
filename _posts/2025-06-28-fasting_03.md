# Four Days With Jesus ✝️✨
- Day 3 of 4 OMG! 🙌
- For this morning there are a few scriptures we touched and we also prayed over them. 🙏

## Day 03: Understanding our LORD 🧠💡
- **Highlight**:
    - *"Is that again, keep seeking wisdom and his kingdom then the rest is history!"* 🌟
- **Scriptures**:📖

### Psalms 77:1-15 🙏
- *"I cry aloud to God; I cry aloud, and he hears me. In times of trouble i pray to the Lord; all night long i lift my hands in prayer, but i cannot find comfort. When i think of God, i sigh; when i meditate, i feel **discouraged**. He keeps me awake all night; I am so worried that i cannot speak. I think of days gone by and remember years of long ago. I spend the night in deep thought; I meditate, and this is what i ask myself: 'Will the Lord always reject us? Has he stopped loving us? Does his promise no longer stand? Has God forgotten to be merciful? Has anger taken the place of his compassion?' Then i said, 'What hurts me most is that God is no longer powerful' I will remember your great deeds,LORD; I will recall the wonders you did in the past. I will think about all that you did in the past. I will think about all you have done; I will meditate on all your might acts. Everything you, O God, is holy. No God is as great as you. You are the God who works miracles; you showed your might among the nations. By your power you saved your people, the descendants of Jacob and of Joseph"*
- **Reflections**:
    - Sometimes we go through seasons where we think God is not there for us, we go through tough times and think that God has given up on us, then we question him, we cry, we mourn over why he is not showing up, or take over our battles. But then, the scripture talks about, remembering what God has done for us, the sins he has saved us from, sins that we thought we could never be saved from, sins that destroyed us, sins that gave us regrets, sins that gave us depressions, sins that gave us anger, sins that gave us no hope and so i pray in the name of Jesus that, we may remain grateful and true to God. Our God saves, he is a loving God and there is none like him. He sent his one and only son to die for our sins, that we may live, that we may be alive again, that we may live in peace, in joy and that we may come back and reconsile with him. ✝️❤️
    - God has something big in store for us.

## Lamentations 3:19-27 🌅
- *"The thought of my pain, my homelessness, is bitter poison; I think of it constantly and my spirit is depressed. Yet hope returns when i remember one thing: The LORD's unfailing love and mercy still continue, Fresh as the morning, as sure as the sunrise. The LORD is all i have, and so i put all my hope in him. The LORD is good to everyone who trusts in him, so it is best for us to wait in patience, to wait for him to save us and it is best to learn this patience in our youth."* 💛
<br>

## Ephesians 4:11-16 🌱
- *"So Christ himself gave the apostles, prophets, the evangelists, the pastors and teachers, to equip his people for works of service, so that the **body of Christ may be built up** until we all reach unity in the faith and become mature, attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ. Then we will no longer be infants, tossed back and forth by the waves, and blown here and there by every wind of teaching and by the cunning and craftiness of people in their **deceitful scheming**. Instead, speaking the truth in love, we will grow to become in every respect the mature body of him who is the head, that is, Christ. From him the whole body, joined and held together by every supporting ligament, grows and builds itself up in love, as each part does its work."*
- **Reflections**:
    - I believe that, though we should be patient and wait for God, that we may play our roles and use our gifts and talents to bring more people back to Christ. To help build his kingdom as unity. 
    - That we should help one another, and carry each other's loads, that we may grow in Christ together. Just as the tree grows to fruition, that we may also prosper together as one. 
    - Also knowing what exactly your role is, in this world and hence i encourage that you pray and ask God what he desires you to do, to maintain and grow his kingdom. 🙏

## In conclusion 🏁
- As we journey through this fast, let us remember that God is always with us, even in moments of doubt or weakness. He hears our cries and is faithful to deliver us. 
- Let us continue to seek wisdom, trust in His unfailing love, and support one another as the body of Christ. Together, we grow stronger, more united, and more rooted in His purpose for our lives. 
- May we finish this fast with grateful hearts, renewed faith, and a deeper understanding of our Lord. Keep pressing on—God has amazing things in store for you!
