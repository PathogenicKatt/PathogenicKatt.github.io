# Four Days With Jesus ✝️✨
- Day 4 of 4 OMG! 🙌
- For this morning we touched one scripture 🙏

## Day 04: Lukewarm Christians 🧠💡
- **Highlight**:
    - *"Let's properly represent the kingdom of God"* 🌟
- **Scriptures**:📖

### Jeremiah 24: Two Baskets of Figs
- *"The LORD showed me two baskets of figs placed in front of the temple. The first basket contained good figs, those that ripen early; the other one contained bad figs, too bad to eat. Then the LORD said to me, 'Jeremiah, what do you see?' I answered, 'Figs. The good ones are very good, and the bad ones are very bad, too bad to eat' So the LORD said to me 'I, the LORD, the God of israel, consider that the people who were taken waya to Babylonia are like these good figs, and I will treat them with kindness. I will watch over them and bring them back to this land. I will build them up and not tear them down; I will plant them and not pull them up. I will give them the desire to know that i am the LORD. Then there will be my people , and i will be their God, because they will return to me with all their heart. As for King Zedekiah of Judah, the politicians round him, and the rest of the people of Jerusalem who have stayed in this land or moved to Egypt- and I the LORD will treat them all like these figs that are too bad to eat. I will bring such a disaster on them that all the nations of the world will be terrified. People will mock them, make jokes anbout them , ridicule them and use their name as a curse everywhere I scatter them. I will bring war, starvation, and disease on them until there is not one of them left in the land that i gave to them and their ancestors' "*
- **Reflections**💭:
    - The "good figs" represent the exiles taken to Babylon—those God would protect and restore. 
    - The "bad figs" symbolize those who remained in Jerusalem or fled to Egypt—facing judgment. 
    - God discerns hearts: The exiles sought Him despite suffering, while the others hardened their hearts. 
    - You cannot be both—good or bad, hot or cold. There’s no middle ground. 
    - Lukewarm Christianity misrepresents God’s truth. 
    - Live boldly for Christ—don’t let society define your faith. 🌍✝️
    - Seek wisdom, pursue righteousness, and represent God faithfully. 🙏✨

## In Conclusion 🎯
- This vision of the figs is a powerful reminder that God sees our hearts and calls us to wholehearted devotion. 🔍❤️ There’s no room for lukewarm faith—we must choose to follow Him fully or risk being rejected like the bad figs. Let’s represent His Kingdom with truth, passion, and integrity, so the world sees His light through us. 🌟🔥

- Stay faithful. Stay bold. Stay on fire for God! 🙌🔥
