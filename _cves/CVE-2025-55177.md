## Summary
Incomplete authorization vulnerability in WhatsApp for iOS, WhatsApp Business for iOS, and WhatsApp for Mac that could allow an unrelated user to trigger *processing of content* from an **arbitrary URL** on a target's device.
- **Impact** <br>
    -> Bypass device synchronization security controls. <br>
    -> Potentially execute sophisticated attacks when combined with an OS-level vulnerability. <br>
    -> Trigger processing of arbitrary content on a target's device. <br>

## Exploitation
- Again, The vulnerability stems from incomplete authorization of *linked device synchronization* messages in WhatsApp for iOS prior to **v2.25.21.73**, WhatsApp Business for iOS **v2.25.21.78**, and WhatsApp for Mac **v2.25.21.78**, caused by an insufficient level of authorization when handling linked device synchronization messages.
- WhatsApp's multi-device architecture allows users to link secondary devices (like desktops or tablets) to their primary account. To coordinate this, WhatsApp uses synchronisation messages that carry metadata and content between devices.
- The vulnerability becomes significantly more dangerous when chained with other exploits.
- Security researchers believe **CVE-2025–55177** was exploited in conjunction with **CVE-2025–43300**, an Apple ImageIO vulnerability that allowed memory corruption via malicious images. 
- Using this vulnerability, a malicious actor who has no legitimate association with the target could force a victim's device to process content from an arbitrary URL on its own behalf if exploited.
- The manipulation of trusted communication channels could serve as an entry point for remote code execution, or unauthorized delivery of malicious content, directly from the attacker's infrastructure.
- It is mentioned that this was a sophisticated attack. Not much information has been shared regarding the exploitation.

## Mitigation and Remediation
- Immediate Actions Required:
    - Update WhatsApp for iOS to version 2.25.21.73 or later.
    - Update WhatsApp Business for iOS to version 2.25.21.78 or later.
    - Update WhatsApp for Mac to version 2.25.21.78 or later.
    - Apply Apple's security updates addressing CVE-2025-43300.
- Additional Security Measures:
    - Review linked device configurations and remove unnecessary connections.
