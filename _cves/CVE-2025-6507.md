## Summary
This issue affects the latest master branch version 3.47.0.99999.
 The vulnerability arises from the ability to bypass regular expression filters intended to prevent malicious parameter injection in JDBC connections. Attackers can manipulate spaces between parameters to evade detection, allowing for unauthorized file access and code execution. The vulnerability is addressed in version **3.46.0.8**.
- **Products**: It affects *Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software* and *Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software*.
- **Problem Type**: It is a vulnerability in the *Site-to-Site IPsec VPN component* of the software.

## Exploitation
- Right, so we understand that the exploitation occurs in the weaknesses of **regular expression pattern matching**.
- **Space Manipulation Technique**
    - The primary method identified involves manipulating spaces between parameters to *evade detection* by security filters.
    - This technique specifically targets regular expression filters that are designed to prevent malicious parameter injection in **JDBC connections**.
    - **JDBC**: _JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) connections allow Java applications to interact with databases by providing a standard API for querying and updating data. They are established using a connection URL, which specifies the database type, server address, and other connection properties_
- **Filter Evasion Mechanism**
    - This approach allows malicious actors to:<br>
    -> Bypass parameter validation that relies on specific pattern matching.<br>
    -> Inject malicious parameters into JDBC connections undetected.<br>
    -> Exploit **deserialization processes** of untrusted data.<br> _(An attacker sends a malicious, custom-built data packet to a system. The system blindly trusts this packet and, while processing it, is tricked into executing the attacker's code instead of just reading data.)_
_This vulnerability (CVE-2025-6507) carries a critical CVSS score of **9.8**, highlighting the severe impact of successful filter bypass techniques_

## Mitigation
Organizations using **h2oai/h2o-3** should immediately upgrade to version 3.46.0.8 to mitigate this high-severity security risk.
