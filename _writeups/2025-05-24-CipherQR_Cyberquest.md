## Challenge Overview
- This was the following description for the challenge:

## Approach:

<br>

1. **File Check**: This is important to check what type of a file is it.
   ```bash
   file Q.rrr.png
   ```
2. **Meta-Data**: "Data about data",tells us crucial info about the image. As you can see from the screenshot that there is an error with the file, by using the following command. Now, with that in mind, what came straight to my mind was  to check the format of the png.
   ```bash
   exiftool Q.rrr.png
   ``` 
- By comparing the first 8 bytes(called the *Magic number*), of the normal png and the one that we have. <br>
- Starting with the normal png(every png must have the correct first 8 bytes), just like so: <br>
   ![Recon Screenshot](/assets/img/PNG-Gradient_hex.png){: .writeup-image }
<br>

- But if we look at our given png(Q.rrr.png): <br>
   ![Recon Screenshot](/assets/img/CipherQR(3).PNG){: .writeup-image }

   - That output, is shown using the following command(*You should see more than what i have shown*):
   ```bash
   hexedit Q.rrr.png
   ```
   - After running that comand, you should be able to change the hexadecimal(values), to be the same as the normal png, REMEMBER, only the first 8 bytes, and then save it `Ctrl + x`.
   - From there you should be able to see the image(the QR code). There are many ways that you could do so.
      - That is you open the file as normal, you could use the following command: <br>
      ```bash
      eog Q.rrr.png
      ```
      - Other way, you can use the `exiftool` again, like as shown above. <br>
   - You can scan the QR code, and what you see, is what is called *Morse Code*(dots and dashes) encryption. Well, i know this through exprience. It is very common to come across a *Morse Code* encryption whenever you solve CTF Challenges. <br>
      ![Recon Screenshot](/assets/img/CipherQR(4).PNG){: .writeup-image }

   - Again there are many tools you could use to decrypt the *Morse Code*:
      - I like to use the following tool [dcode](https://www.dcode.fr/en), great tool!
      - Type in "morse code", in the search bar, and paste the morse code.
      - You should see the flag(the first string). <br>
