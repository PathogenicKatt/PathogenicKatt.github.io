## Challenge Overview:
- This was the description for the challenge:

## Approach:

1. **Importing the file:**I always prefer to have open PicoCTF website on my local machine and then use the virtual machine to solve problems, as you can see i use the `wget` command to get the file.
2. **Viewing what we dealing with**:

    - To open the picture you use the following command:
    ```bash
    eog cat.jpg
    ```
    - When viewed this picture, i thought of many approaches, such as *image steganography*- which involves hidden information inside the image.
    - But even before going there the standard approach always stays the same, that is to check the file type and the metadata.
3. **Further Analysis**: We need to verify and know what we are solving.

- informaion about file:
    ```bash
    file cat.jpg
    ```
- Meta-data of the image:
    ```bash
    exiftool cat.jpg
    ```
- So now, we see strange things. This is when you know that it could be you the vulnerability or in this case, our hidden flag. Normally, the meta-data should should the data in clear text. But in this case we some gibberish, what's that. A closer look: <br>

- This looks like some text, encoded to hide information.
- The encoding method, that always comes in my mind is `base64`, and it is common in ctf challenges.

4. **Decoding**: Let's see what happens when decode the encoded text using base64. Normally you see a base64 with an equal sign at the end of the decoded text. But in this, we do not see that.

- the flagðŸ˜†:
    ```bash
    echo "cGljb0NURnt0aGVfbTN0YWRhdGFfMXNfbW9kaWZpZWR9" | base64 -d
    ```
- Alternatively, if you do not like the terminal. You could use the following to [Cyberchef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/). Great tool!, that has almost all the encryption/encoding/hashing methods, and allows to decode as well.
