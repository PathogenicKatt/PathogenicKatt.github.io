# Computer Architecture Fundamentals 

Binary Exploitation - something about those two words intrigues me profoundly. 

## The Language of Machines

**"Binary"** - those two bits (0 and 1) form the foundation of all computation. It's fascinating that this simple representation:

- Comprises all machine code computers understand 
- Forms the basis of every digital device 
- Represents the fundamental "language" of technology 

Just as humans communicate through languages, computers speak in binary. 

## The Art of Exploitation 

**"Exploitation"** represents the most fundamental attack vector: 

> "To truly break a system, target its core components" 

Without 0s and 1s, there is no:
- Operating systems 
- Applications 
- Digital infrastructure 

## Bridging the Gap

As humans, we needed ways to interface with this binary world:

1. **Machine Code**: Direct binary representation 
2. **Assembly Language**: Human-readable low-level abstraction 
3. **Higher-Level Languages**: Further abstractions (C, Rust, etc.) 

Pioneers like John von Neumann developed these crucial abstraction layers that make exploitation possible. 

## Why This Matters

The ability to exploit binaries represents:
- A deep understanding of system fundamentals 
- The power to manipulate systems at their core 
- An underappreciated skillset in modern cybersecurity 

# Now, The Best Part!
We need to cover essential computer architecture concepts, focusing on **Central Processing Unit(CPU)**, **memory**, then **registers**, and then lastly **execution flow**.
    
### 1. CPU Basics
*The CPU executes instructions stored in the memory*, key concepts:
- **Instruction Set Architecture(ISA)**:
    Defines how the CPU works(**x86**, **ARM**, **MIPS**, etc).
- **Register**
    "I have been waiting for this one ðŸ˜…", 
     A register is just a fast storage locations inside the CPU.
- **Execution Flow**
    Simply, how the CPU fetches, Decodes and Execute.
