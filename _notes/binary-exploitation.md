# Binary Exploitation

Binary exploitation is the practice of leveraging software vulnerabilities to influence program behavior in unintended ways. It’s a foundational skill in **Offensive Security** and **Reverse Engineering**.


## Why Study Binary Exploitation?

- **Software is fragile:** Even a minor bug can compromise an entire system.
- **Abstractions leak:** Regardless of the programming language, everything ultimately runs on binary logic.
- **Control is possible:** With the right knowledge, you can manipulate programs at the lowest level.


## How Rare Is This Skill?

- **~90% of programmers:** “Buffer what now?”
- **~9%:** “I’ve heard of that…”
- **~1% or fewer:** “Pass me GDB, I’m about to pop a shell.”


## Learning Path

### 1. Foundational Knowledge

- **Computer Architecture:**  
  Understand cpu registers, memory layout, and the stack/heap.
- **Programming:**  
  Proficiency in C, C++, and Assembly(x86,x64) is essential.
- **Operating Systems:**  
  Learn about processes, memory management, and OS-level protections.
- **Networking Basics:**  
  Some exploits propagate over networks—know the basics(sockets, Protocols, etc).

### 2. Core Topics

- **Reverse Engineering:**  
  Analyze and debug binaries to uncover their secrets(usually through Ghidra-tool).
- **Memory Corruption:**  
  Explore buffer overflows, format string vulnerabilities, and use-after-free bugs(GDB).
- **Exploit Development:**  
  Write shellcode, build ROP chains, and bypass modern defenses like ASLR and DEP.
- **Post-Exploitation:**  
  Gaining access is just the start—what comes next?

### 3. Advanced Areas

- **Kernel Exploitation:**  
  Delve into vulnerabilities at the operating system’s core.
- **Browser Exploitation:**  
  Target web browsers and their JavaScript engines.
- **Binary Protections:**  
  Study the latest defense mechanisms and how to overcome them.
- **Automated Exploit Generation:**  
  Explore tools and techniques for automating vulnerability discovery and exploitation.

## Tools
- **Ghidra**:
  Ghidra an ideal tool for identifying and mapping out functions that may be of further interest to a malware analyst.
  Normally used for static analysis. Disclaimer: Ghidra should only be used in a sandboxed environment such as a virtual 
  machine designed for analyzing malware.  
- **GDB(GNU Debugger)**:
  A great tool that can pause the execution of a running program and let you examine/take control of its memory. It's 
  probably one of the most powerful tools that can help you nail down the exact cause of a problem with your program.
