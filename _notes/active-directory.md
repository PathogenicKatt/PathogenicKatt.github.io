# Active Directory (AD)
_Active Directory (AD) is a directory service for Windows network environments._
- AD provides authentication and authorization functions within a Windows domain environment.
- It is designed to be *backward-compatible*, and many features are arguably not "secure by default," and it can be easily misconfigured.
- AD is essentially a sizeable read-only database accessible to all users within the domain, regardless of their privilege level.
