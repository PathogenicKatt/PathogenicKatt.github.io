# Broad-View of Cryptography
## Basic Terminology
- **Plain-Text** -> The unencrypted or "original" message.
- **Cipher-Text** -> The encrypted message
- **Cipher** -> An algorithm for performing encryption and decryption.
- **Key** -> A piece of information that specifies the transformation of plain-text into cipher-text or vice-versa.

## Type of Ciphers
- **Symmetric** -> Uses a shared key as part of an algprithm
- **Asymmetric** -> Uses a public and private key as part of the algorithm.
- **Block Cipher**
- **Stream Cipher**
