      <h2>Academic Journey</h2>
      <p>Technology was never my initial dream, it all started when I first tested the power of coding. By my second semester at the University of Mpumalanga (UMP), where I studied Bachelor in Information & Communication Technology (BICT), I was already tutoring programming. Through deep engagement with coding, I discovered cybersecurity and knew I wanted to pursue it further, which led me to transfer to North West University (NWU) in 2023 to pursue a BSc in Computer Science and Mathematics.</p>
      <p>My real breakthrough came through NWU's participation in the <strong>SANReN Cybersecurity Challenge</strong>. The first two years, I wasn't skilled enough to qualify for the finals, but through perseverance, I finally qualified in my third year. A moment that truly defined my journey.</p>

          <p class="cert-desc">I qualified for and participated in the SANReN Cybersecurity Challenge finals as part of an accomplished team. My team divided the work based on individual strengths, and my focus was <strong>Forensics and Reverse Engineering</strong>. The competition spanned 5 days with two distinct challenges: one day for Attack & Defense, where I concentrated on automating defensive scripts in Python to block intruders and prevent them from compromising our flags, and three days for CTF covering Web Exploitation, Forensics, Cryptography, and Reverse Engineering. Over this intensive competition, my team and I demonstrated strong technical problem-solving abilities. The scoreboard image above captures our team's standing just 24 hours before the competition concluded.
