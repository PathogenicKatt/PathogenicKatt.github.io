      <h2>Academic Journey</h2>
      <p>My Cybersecurity journey began in 2022 while studying, Bachelor in Information & Communication Technology(BICT) at  University of Mpumalanga (UMP). Seeking deeper technical challenges, I transferred to North West University (NWU) in 2023 to pursue Bsc with Computer Science and Mathematics.</p>
      <p>Though NWU doesn't offer formal cybersecurity courses, their participation in the <strong> SANReN CSC </strong> program became my hands-on training ground. This competition ignited my passion for security research. In 2025, I qualified for the <strong>SANReN Cybersecurity Challenge finals</strong>, which validated my technical skills and dedication. Reaching the finals still remains a core goal for 2026 and beyond.</p>

          <p class="cert-desc">I qualified for and participated in the SANReN Cybersecurity Challenge finals as part of an accomplished team. The SANReN Cybersecurity Challenge is a regional competition that brings together not only South African universities but also leading institutions from neighboring countries, including Namibia, Eswatini, Lesotho, and Zimbabwe. The competition consists of two stages: a qualification round followed by the finals, where participants face diverse cybersecurity challenges spanning Reverse Engineering, Web Exploitation, Forensics, and Mobile Hacking. Over three consecutive days of intensive, continuous competition, my team and I demonstrated strong technical problem-solving abilities and deep cybersecurity expertise. The scoreboard image shown here captures our team's standing just 24 hours before the competition concluded, reflecting the highly competitive and demanding nature of this prestigious regional event.

          <p class="cert-org"><strong>Issuer:</strong> EarTech Innovations</p>
          <p class="cert-year"><strong>Year:</strong> 2025</p>
          <p class="cert-desc">During my internship at EarTech Innovations, I gained comprehensive hands-on experience across multiple cybersecurity and cloud technologies. I developed foundational cybersecurity knowledge through practical CTF challenges on HackTheBox and advanced my exploitation skills using Metasploit with vulnerable systems. I explored artificial intelligence fundamentals, including how adversaries leverage AI to evolve their exploit strategies. My Azure cloud experience encompassed configuring firewalls, deploying AI services through Azure AI Foundry to build intelligent chatbots and custom prompt flows with evaluation tools, and implementing Azure AI Search services. I also learned Azure Networking Services, access control implementation frameworks, Azure DevOps practices, and design fundamentals using Figma.</p>
          <p class="cert-desc">I studied critical organizational resilience concepts including Business Continuity Planning, Disaster Recovery Planning, and Incident Response protocols. Additionally, I gained theoretical knowledge of blockchain technology, understanding its cryptographic foundations, decentralization, and data integrity mechanisms. I developed expertise in prompt engineering and large language models, learning effective prompting techniques including chain-of-thought reasoning and identifying security vulnerabilities. I analyzed malware types, their operational impacts, mitigation strategies, and threat detection methods. Finally, I gained practical knowledge of Agile methodology and Scrum frameworks for effective project management. This internship provided a well-rounded foundation in modern cybersecurity, cloud architecture, and emerging technologies essential for the evolving security landscape.</p>
